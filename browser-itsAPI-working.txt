We have learnt it before.

When we write something in text editor for our website, the website make the html & css codes into DOM(Document Object...)

"HTML DOM tree" is created from html codes

"Style rules" is created from css style sheet

Both are made together to create "RENDER tree"


Then a "layout" is made from RENDER tree
