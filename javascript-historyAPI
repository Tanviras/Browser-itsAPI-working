window.history.back()
This acts exactly as if the user clicked on the Back button in their browser toolbar.

window.history.forward()
Similarly, you can move forward (as if the user clicked the Forward button), like this:



Moving to a specific point in history

You can use the go() method to load a specific page from session history, identified by its relative position to the current page. (The current page's relative position is 0.)
To move back one page (the equivalent of calling back()):

window.history.go(-1)

To move forward a page, just like calling forward():

window.history.go(1)




To reload the page

window.history.go(0) or,
window.history.go()
